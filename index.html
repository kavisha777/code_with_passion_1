    <h3>My Dreams and Goals</h3>
    <p>I am a passionate and determined girl from Jaffna, shaping my future through learning and hard work. I am currently studying Software Engineering at the Open University and planning to start the NDT in IT at ITUM Moratuwa. Alongside tech, I am excited to learn tailoring, a skill I believe will open new creative opportunities. My dreams don't stop there—I want to become a skilled web developer, a lawyer who fights for justice, and a YouTuber who shares lifestyle, vlogs, and reviews with the world. I believe that pursuing multiple passions makes me stronger and more complete. Every day, I take steps forward—coding, studying law, preparing to learn tailoring, and planning my YouTube journey—to build a future I truly believe in.</p>
